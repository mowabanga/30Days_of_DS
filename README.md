This will be a 30 day or less challenge in revisiting some topics I tackled while learning DS ages ago. I might be dusty but at the very end, I will have at least 5 solid DS projects worthy of show casing in my portfolio.

The journey captures:
	- Basics of python
	- Data structures in python
	- Algos in Python
	- Loops and iterations in Python
	- Data manipulation & Analysis
	- Data Visualization
	- Data storage & retrieval
	- Machine Learning(ML)
	- Real world applications of ML

This will be a fun little project that I most def. will see the end of.

Projects that I'll build along the way:
	- Credit card fraud detection
	- Recommender systems
	- Classifying breast cancer
	- Logistic Regression
	- Data Analysis for Hospitals
